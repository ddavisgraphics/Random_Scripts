# Random_Scripts
Automated Scripts, things to make my life easier.

## PS_Monthly_Stats
This is a database script written in SQL that exports data into a CSV file after making the contents more human readable.  State date and end date in where clause will have to be adjusted from month-to-month as needed.

## Username_grab
This is a sql script I had to use to get all reservations from a specific username.  It was interesting case of where a student figured out he could write a script to reserve rooms and was reserving rooms once every second, which caused a red flag to raise on our end.  We could stop this with a captch, but it technically isn't an illegal use of the software.  I even say, bravo to the student.
