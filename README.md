# Random_Scripts
Automated Scripts, things to make my life easier.

## PS_Monthly_Stats
This is a database script written in SQL that exports data into a CSV file after making the contents more human readable.  State date and end date in where clause will have to be adjusted from month-to-month as needed.

## Username_grab
This is a sql script I had to use to get all reservations from a specific username.  It was interesting case of where captcha are needed on public websites.  The student scripted a way to fill out the form and reserver a room once a second.
