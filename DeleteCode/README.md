# Delete Code Script
- Serves 2 purposes.
The first was that I needed to delete code from a repo on a large scale, but was lazy.
The second was I can never remember the pure command line way of doing this when I have to use it every so often and spend more time reading docs and figuring it out than just re-running my script.
